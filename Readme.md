# AWS-DevOps Projects



This repository showcases a collection of **AWS-DevOps projects** that I have successfully completed as part of my AWS-DevOps learning journey. These projects demonstrate my practical experience in implementing DevOps practices using AWS services and tools. Each project reflects my growing expertise in cloud computing, automation, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, and other DevOps methodologies.



## Key Highlights



The projects included in this repository cover a wide range of topics and scenarios, such as:



- **Building and Automating CI/CD Pipelines**: Leveraging tools like AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy to automate application deployment processes.  

- **Containerization and Orchestration**: Using Docker and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) to containerize and deploy applications.  

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Creating and managing infrastructure using tools like AWS CloudFormation and Terraform.  

- **Monitoring and Logging**: Setting up monitoring and observability solutions with Amazon CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray.  

- **Serverless Architectures**: Developing and deploying serverless applications using AWS Lambda and API Gateway.  

- **High Availability and Scalability**: Designing and deploying fault-tolerant, scalable architectures using AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), Auto Scaling Groups, and Amazon RDS.  



## Repository Structure



Each project directory contains:



1. A detailed **README file** explaining:

   - Objectives

   - Architecture

   - Steps involved

   - Technologies used

2. Source code, configuration files, and scripts to provide a comprehensive understanding of the implementation.
